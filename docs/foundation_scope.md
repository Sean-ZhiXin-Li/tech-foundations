# Tech Foundations: Long-Term Capability Orientation and Scope

## 1. Long-Term Capability Orientation

This repository is designed to support the long-term development of a **balanced technical and research capability structure** for work on complex engineered and autonomous systems.

Rather than committing to a specific discipline or career title, the focus is on cultivating transferable skills and methodologies that remain valuable across different domains and academic stages.

The long-term capability distribution guiding this repository is approximately:

- **Computation and Intelligent Methods (~35%)**  
  Programming, algorithmic thinking, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and experimental reproducibility.

- **Control and Systems Thinking (~25%)**  
  Feedback control, controller design concepts, closed-loop decision-making, and system-level reasoning.

- **Dynamics and Physical Modeling (~20%)**  
  Kinematics, dynamics, state evolution, and continuous system modeling.

- **Engineering Context and Constraints (~12%)**  
  Practical considerations from real-world engineered systems, including scale, constraints, and engineering intuition.

- **Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Sensing (~8%)**  
  Sensors, actuators, hardware–software interfaces, and uncertainty in physical systems.

These proportions are intended as **long-term directional constraints**, not as a rigid curriculum or a declaration of future specialization.

## 2. Role of Tech Foundations

Tech Foundations (FT) serves as a **pre-research training and consolidation repository**.

Its primary purpose is to transform previously acquired knowledge and experiments into **stable, reusable foundations** that can support future projects, research work, and competitive or academic applications.

FT emphasizes:
- Method abstraction
- Experimental structure
- Reproducibility practices
- Conceptual clarity

rather than novelty or performance optimization.

## 3. Explicit Scope and Boundaries

### What Belongs in Tech Foundations

FT is limited to:
- Modular demonstrations of methods or tools
- Controller abstractions and design patterns
- Simulation and experimentation workflows
- Visualization and analysis utilities
- Experimental logging standards and templates

All content in FT should be **self-contained, interpretable, and transferable**.

### What Does NOT Belong in Tech Foundations

FT explicitly does not:
- Build end-to-end or production-level systems
- Host long-running or evolving research experiments
- Optimize for task-specific performance
- Replace or mirror any main project or research repository

Domain-specific integration, system-scale experimentation, and sustained research development are intentionally deferred to separate main projects.

---

## 4. Design Philosophy

Tech Foundations functions as a **capability archive rather than an application layer**.

Once a method, workflow, or concept is sufficiently validated and documented within FT, it is considered *frozen* and maintained only for clarity or compatibility—not continuous expansion.

This separation ensures that future projects can build on a stable technical base without accumulating structural or conceptual debt.
