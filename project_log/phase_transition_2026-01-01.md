# Phase Transition Note

**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Context:** Transition from Tech Foundations (FT) construction phase to primary research / project focus

---

## 1. What Has Been Frozen

* Tech Foundations capability index has been finalized and frozen.
* Cross-domain controller abstraction has been defined and fixed.
* Experiment logging standard (5-section template) is enforced and validated.
* A completed ND task has been successfully rewritten using the frozen template.
* Tech Foundations is downgraded to low-frequency maintenance mode.

---

## 2. What Is Now Out of Scope

* Adding new demos or exploratory experiments to Tech Foundations.
* Expanding or modifying the frozen experiment log structure.
* Treating FT as a learning playground or trial-and-error space.
* Mixing exploratory, unfinished, or system-level work into FT.
* Incrementally "polishing" FT without structural justification.

---

## 3. What Becomes the Primary Focus

* Advancing a main project with system-level objectives.
* Conducting research-grade experiments outside of FT.
* Learning new methods only when driven by concrete problems.

---

## Closing Statement

Tech Foundations now serves as a stable technical base.
Future progress depends on applying these frozen capabilities to real systems rather than expanding the foundation itself.
