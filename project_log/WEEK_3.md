# Week 3 – Project Log

## Date
2025/09/28

## Progress
- **CAD (Side Track)**  
  - Completed the 2-link manipulator assembly.  
  - Added two bracket supports ("ears") on the Base so that Link1 can rotate between them.  
  - Established the two main joints:  
    - **Shoulder Joint** (Base ↔ Link1)  
    - **Elbow Joint** (Link1 ↔ Link2)  
  - Verified the motion of both joints in Fusion 360.  
  - Exported deliverables:  
    - `2-Link Manipulator.f3d` (Fusion file)  
    - `2-Link Manipulator.png` (Isometric screenshot)  
    - `2-Link Manipulator.stl` (3D model file)

- **AI (Main Track – Preparation)**  
  - Stable-Baselines3 PPO + CartPole training not yet executed.  
  - Training scripts are ready; plan to run during National Day holiday.

## Plan (National Day 16 Days)
- **Days 49–56**  
  - CAD: finalize supports, create exploded view, and add end-effector.  
  - AI: learn Gymnasium basics and run the first CartPole baseline.  
- **Days 57–64**  
  - CAD: finalize deliverables (screenshot + README).  
  - AI: complete PPO CartPole training and reward curve visualization.  
  - Study differences between imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

## Commitment
- I will master the AI part (PPO CartPole with SB3) within the 16-day National Day schedule.  
- At the end of the holiday, both Main Track (AI) and Side Track (CAD) will be complete and deliverables will be submitted.
