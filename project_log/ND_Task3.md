# NDT3 â€“ Install Webots and Run Official e-puck Demo World

## Task
Install Webots and run the official e-puck demo world.

## Progress
- Successfully installed **Webots R2025a**.
- Opened and ran the official demo world:  
  `projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/worlds/e-puck_line_demo.wbt`
- Verified the simulation works:
  - The **e-puck robot** followed the black line using built-in sensors.
  - Console printed sensor and state values in real time.
  - Controller source code (`e-puck_line_demo.c`) was visible and linked to the robot.

## Outcome
- Environment is ready for further experiments with e-puck.
- Basic demo world tested successfully, ensuring Webots installation is correct.

## Next Steps
- Try parameter tuning in the demo controller (e.g., changing speed constants).
- Explore a simpler world (`e-puck.wbt`) to better understand robot sensors.
- Prepare for more advanced tasks such as wall-following or obstacle avoidance.
