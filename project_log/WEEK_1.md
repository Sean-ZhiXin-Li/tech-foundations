# Week 1 Project Log

**Date:** 2025-09-14  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Arduino (Embedded Systems)
- Learned basic functions:  
  - `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, `delay()`
- Implemented the **Blink program** to control the built-in LED:
  - LED toggles ON/OFF every 1 second
- Verified successful compilation and upload to the UNO R4 board

---

## Fusion 360 (CAD)
### Cube
- Created user parameter: `side = 40 mm`
- Drew a center rectangle (side × side), fully parameterized
- Extruded distance = `side` to form a 40 × 40 × 40 mm cube
- Exported files:
  - `cube.f3d`
  - `cube.png`
  - `cube.stl`

### Cylinder
- Created user parameters:  
  - `dia = 30 mm`  
  - `h = 50 mm`
- Drew a center circle (diameter = `dia`)
- Extruded distance = `h` to form a cylinder
- Exported files:
  - `cylinder.f3d`
  - `cylinder.png`
  - `cylinder.stl`

---

## Deliverables
- **Arduino**: Blink program (`.ino`)
- **Fusion 360**: Cube and Cylinder (`.f3d`, `.png`, `.stl`)

---

## Reflection
This week I successfully:
- Learned Arduino syntax and verified the LED Blink program
- Completed two parameterized CAD models (Cube + Cylinder)
- Practiced exporting design files for documentation and future use

Next week, I plan to:
- Upload all deliverables to GitHub (with README.md)
- Try Arduino experiments with external LEDs and resistors
- Explore more Fusion 360 sketches with constraints
